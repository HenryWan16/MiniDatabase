# MiniDatabase
The Mini database could be used to make SQL statement come true without additional library, including inserting, deleting, searching, aggregation functions and so on. With the help of data storing, multi-thread controlling, we can have a good way to manage resources on the operating system. In order to recover from the disaster, we need to use a better strategy to manage the buffer pool including FIFO, LRU and so on.
